Version 1.3

1) now you can choose the weights for point sources / plane waves.

2) now you can choose different types of colorbar (symmetric or non-symmetric).


Version 1.31

1) fix the bug: unify the font size of different xlabels on the App (interior simulation).

2） remove the titles "Simulation Setup", "Ground Truth", "Estimation" and "Errors" from the saved figures.

3） remove the units of colorbars when choosing "Linear Plots", keep the unit "dB" when choosing "dB Plots"



Version 1.4

1) Create another button called "Save Data" to save some specific matrices.
   In that way, the original "Save Plots" button will only save the four plots.

2) Add a script which allows you to call the App from outside and run simulation with different setups.


Version 1.5

1) Now you can input negative values for "Src x-coord", "Src y-coord", "Src z-coord", and "Src Weights".
2) Now you can input complex numbers for "Src Weights".
