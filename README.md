# Limitations-of-SSH

Official Implementation of: *Limitations and Performance Analysis of Spherical Sector Harmonics for Sound Field Processing*

This repository provides MATLAB apps and scripts for demonstrating the radial extrapolation of sound fields using Spherical Sector Harmonics (SSHs). In this repository, you will find:

1. MATLAB apps designed for the case of **Exterior Sound Fields**.
2. MATLAB apps designed for the case of **Interior Sound Fields**.
3. MATLAB scripts to control, modify parameters, and run the app for the exterior case.
4. MATLAB scripts to control, modify parameters, and run the app for the interior case.

### How to Use
You can either:
- Open the apps directly in MATLAB, input your desired setup parameters, and click the "Run" button in the user interface.
- Run the provided script in the MATLAB editor, input your desired setup parameters, and repeat the same process.

### More Information
Detailed equations and further explanations can be found in the paper: *Limitations and Performance Analysis of Spherical Sector Harmonics for Sound Field Processing.*
